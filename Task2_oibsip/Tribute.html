                Virat Kohli, the former captain of the Indian national cricket team, is not just a cricketer; he's an icon.
                His unmatched consistency, technique, and ability to score runs in all formats of the game make him a cricketing legend.
                I admire him for his extraordinary talent and passion, which are evident every time he steps onto the field.
